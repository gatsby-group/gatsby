- split node transformation, and creation into separate steps
- create remote file nodes before node creation
if all our nodes are transformed at the time of creation,
we can use info about every other node while creating it
this is important for linking remote file nodes.
we can add the id of remote file nodes to the imageFile field of our MediaItem nodes
so that they can be linked in schema customization instead of by overriding the resolver. This should fix a cli bug where it repeats `success Generating image thumbnails - 0.219s - 9/9 41.17/s` over and over for each image on the site
