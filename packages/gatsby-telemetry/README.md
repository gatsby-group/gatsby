# gatsby-telemetry

Gatsby contains a telemetry feature that collects anonymous usage information that helps improve Gatsby for all users.
You will be notified when installing Gatsby and when running it for the first time.

## How to opt-out

Users may always opt-out from the telemetry with `gatsby telemetry --disable` or setting the environment variable `GATSBY_TELEMETRY_DISABLED` to `1`

## Why?

Anonymous aggregate user analytics allow us to prioritise fixes and features based on how, and when people use Gatsby.
Since much of Gatsbyâ€™s function revolves around community plugins and starters, we want to collect information on usage,
and, importantly, reliability, so that we can ensure a high-quality plugin (and soon, theme) ecosystem.

For example:

- We will be able to understand which plugins are used together, surface that information in the public plugin library, and, for example, build more relevant starters and tutorials.
- We will be able to surface popularity of different starters in the starter showcase.
- We will be able to surface error rates in each build stage, and focusing on driving these down over time. We want the experience to remain error free.
- We will be able to surface reliability of different plugins and starters, and detect the ones which seen buggy to then improve these.
- We will be able to see timings for different build stages to guide us in where we should focus optimization work.

## We collect the following data for all events

- Timestamp of the occurrence
- Command invoked (e.g. `build` or `develop`)
- Unique and unidentifiable machine ID
- Unique and unidentifiable session ID
- One-way hashed current working directory
- General OS level information (operating system, version, CPU architecture, and whether the command is run inside a CI)
- Used Gatsby version
- Errors with PII (e.g., paths) sanitized.

In addition to these events, we may collect additional performance affecting measurements, such as how many pages / queries etc. the build involved.
