# gatsby-plugin-remove-trailing-slashes

This plugin removes trailing slashes from your project's paths. For
example, `yoursite.com/about/` becomes `yoursite.com/about`.

## Important considerations
This plugin is intended to remove trailing slashes from paths generated by Gatsby itself.

This however does not prevent the resolution of pages that have trailing slashes, due to the way browsers are built to interpret URLs as paths.

This means that a user will need to take the extra step of ensuring that all router links direct towards paths that do not end in a slash.

For example, `<Link to="/about/">` will render the view related to `/about` but will display as `/about/` in the browsers address bar.

This is an important factor when relying on path driven logic, such as in the use case of the `Link` components `activeClassName` and `activeStyle` props.

For example, if the current route is `/about`, the component `<Link to="/about/" activeStyle={{ color: 'rebeccapurple' }}>` wouldn't match because of the slash.

## Usage

Install:

```
npm install --save-dev gatsby-plugin-remove-trailing-slashes
```

Then configure via `gatsby-config.js`.

```js
{
  ...
  plugins: [
    ...,
    `gatsby-plugin-remove-trailing-slashes`,
  ]
}
```

That's it.
