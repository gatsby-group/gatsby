## Near-ish future

- [ ] init.js for providers to setup clients
- [ ] validate resource config
- [ ] Theme UI preset selection (runs dependent install and file write)
- [ ] Select input supported recipes
- [ ] Refactor resource state to use Redux & record runs in local db
- [ ] move creating the validate function to core and out of resources â€” they just declare their schema
- [ ] gatsby-config.js hardening â€” make it work if there's no plugins set like in hello-world starter
- [ ] get latest version of npm packages so know if can skip running.
- [ ] Make `dependencyType` in NPMPackage an enum (joi2gql doesn't handle this right now from Joi enums)
- [ ] Show in plan if an update will be applied vs. create.
- [ ] Implement config object for GatsbyPlugin
- [ ] Handle JS in config objects? { **\_javascript: "`\${**dirname}/foo/bar`" }
- [ ] handle people pressing Y & quit if they press "n" (for now)
- [ ] Automatically create list of recipes from the recipes directory (recipes resource ðŸ¤”)
