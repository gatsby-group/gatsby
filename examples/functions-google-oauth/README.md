# Gatsby Functions + Google OAuth Example

This example illustrates logging in with Google 0Auth via Gatsby Functions and defining a [private cilent route behind this authentication](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/authentication-tutorial/). The primary focus is on the Functions aspect, not the client side routing/authentication. [This article](https://soshace.com/react-user-login-authentication-using-usecontext-and-usereducer/#crayon-60c920bddc105062139412) has a good example for setting up the client side auth provider you could layer on top of this example.
