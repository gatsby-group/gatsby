Do you want a personal website with a blog running at `your-domain/blog`? Do you like super fast websites with out-of-the-box performance, SEO, and best practices? Do you like automating your work with a straightforward CMS? Well you're in luck!

This tutorial will use [gatsby-personal-starter-blog](http://t.wang.sh/gatsby-personal-starter-blog), a Gatsby starter that I made that is based on the very popular [gatsby-starter-blog](/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog/). The differences being that `gatsby-personal-starter-blog` is configured to run the blog on a subdirectory `/blog`, and comes pre-installed with [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/), and VS Code highlighting for code blocks.

# 4 Steps:

## Step 1

Open your Terminal and run the following command from the Gatsby CLI to create a new Gatsby site using [gatsby-personal-starter-blog](http://t.wang.sh/gatsby-personal-starter-blog).

```sh
gatsby new [your-project-name] https://github.com/thomaswangio/gatsby-personal-starter-blog
```

## Step 2

Once the Gatsby site is finished installing all the packages and dependencies, you can now go into the directory and run the site locally.

```sh
cd [your-project-name]
gatsby develop
```

You'll notice now you can go to `[localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)` to see your new site, but what's cool is that Netlify CMS is pre-installed, and you can access it at `localhost:8000/admin`. A CMS, or content management, is useful because you can add content like blog posts from a dashboard on your site instead of having to add posts manually. However, we want to be able to access the CMS from a deployed website, not just locally. For that, we'll need to deploy to Netlify, set up continuous deployment, and do a few configurations.

## Step 3

Open [github.com](http://github.com) and create a new repository, with the same name as your project. Push your new Gatsby site's code to GitHub using the following Terminal commands:

```sh
git init
git add .
git commit -m "init"
git remote add origin https://github.com/[your-username]/[your-repo-name].git
git push -u origin master
```

Then, open [app.netlify.com](http://app.netlify.com) and add a "New site from Git". Choose your newly created repo and click on "Deploy site".

## Step 4

Open the project in your code editor and open `static/admin/config.yml`. Replace the following piece of code with these settings, replacing `your-username/your-repo-name` with your GitHub username and repo. Then push this code to GitHub.

```js
// Replace this
backend: name: test - repo

// With this
backend: name: github
repo: your - username / your - repo - name
```

To make sure that Netlify CMS has access to your GitHub, you need to set up an OAuth application on GitHub. The instructions for that are here: [https://www.netlify.com/docs/authentication-providers/#using-an-authentication-provider](https://www.netlify.com/docs/authentication-providers/#using-an-authentication-provider). Once you've configured an authentication provider then you'll be able to use Netlify CMS at your deployed site to add new posts.

# Customizing your site

Head into `gatsby-config.js` and you can edit your siteMedata, add a Google Analytics tracking ID, and your app icon/favicon.

To connect your Netlify site to your custom domain, see [Netlify's instructions on custom domains](https://www.netlify.com/docs/custom-domains/). If you want to learn more about Gatsby, you can head over to the [Gatsby documentation](/docs/) and learn how to work with data and their API. To learn more about React to customize the look of your site, the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) has many useful references and guides.
