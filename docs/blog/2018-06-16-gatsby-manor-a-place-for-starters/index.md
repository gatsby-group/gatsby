We launched [Gatsby Manor](https://gatsbymanor.com) to address a long running question: how do we support
themes in Gatsby? See the [Github
issue](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/2662). We labored many months
to engineer a solution to this problem. The result was our website and 6 themes
people could choose from to bootstrap with their Gatsby project. We made it easy
to switch between themes in your project using our cli tool.

However the roadmap of features revealed that our work was competing against the
[Gatsby V2 roadmap](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/projects/2). We want to
lead engineering efforts in the Gatsby ecosystem but addressing the themes
problem at a time when V2 might change fundamentally would put our work at risk.
We never want the community to use our products at the expense of not using the
latest version of Gatsby.

Therefore we sat down to think about the strengths provided by Gatsby and how we
could magnify them. While we built tools to solve the community requested themes
issue we noticed that Gatsby does not need themes, at least not in the way we
created them.

The power of Gatsby lies in empowering developers to spin up new modern sites in
seconds. To put it bluntly: Gatsby makes building modern websites cheap.
Starters are what make site creation cheap.

Therefore we have decided to focus on making the Starter ecosystem as feature
rich as possible. The decision to deprecate most of our original work was a
tough one; the work will forever live on [our
Github](https://github.com/gatsbymanor). But we know that building products
according to the Gatsby teamâ€™s roadmap will allows us to provide awesome
experiences to the ecosystem.
