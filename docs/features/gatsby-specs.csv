Performance,Faster content delivery,Static content,3,3,1,2,"Can you builds your site as 'static' files which can be deployed easily?
Gatsby, like other static site generators, can.
Squarespace allows static content but doesn't allow it to be edited with the CMS (https://developers.squarespace.com/static-pages/). 
Wordpress allows it with some customization. https://www.itsupportguides.com/knowledge-base/wordpress/wordpress-how-to-serve-static-content-from-a-cookieless-domain/"
,,CDN,2,2,2,3,"Site builders come with a CDN out of the box.
Wordpress allows through plugins."
,,AMP support,2,2,2,3,"Google's AMP

,Progressive Web,Offline access,3,1,2,0,"You can set this up w/ Jekyll: https://fossbytes.com/get-jekyll-blog-work-offline/. Mozilla wrote a plugin for Wordpress, which seems to have pretty low adoption: https://wordpress.org/plugins/offline-content/. Squarespace doesn't seem to support this. https://answers.squarespace.com/questions/56762/i-need-to-run-a-demo-of-my-squarespace-website-offline.html"
,,Prefetch linked pages,3,1,1,0,Eg Jekyll: http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html. Content is not preloaded
,,Page caching,3,3,2,0,https://answers.squarespace.com/questions/173452/enabling-browser-cache-for-sqaurespace-site.html
,,No extraneous code fetching,3,0,3,3,"Webpack and Squarespace score well on this one, mostly because they don't try to be SPAs"
,Faster time to interaction,Progressive image loading,3,1,1,1,Load a blurry placeholder image before loading the full heavyweight asset. Medium has this. WP has a plugin (https://wordpress.org/plugins/progressive-images/) with <10 active installs. Squarespace calls Progressive Image loading something else
,,Responsive image loading,3,1,3,3,Load the right size asset given browser size. Wordpress supports this automatically (https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/12/responsive-images-in-wordpress-core/).  Jekyll does it a bit but requires a lot of customization (https://github.com/wildlyinaccurate/jekyll-responsive-image). 
,,Inlines critical CSS,3,1,1,1,"Load page immediately without blocking request for CSS. https://www.sitepoint.com/inline-css-in-jekyll/, https://joe-watkins.io/javascript/inline-critical-css-with-wordpress/, https://answers.squarespace.com/questions/172166/pagesense-optimization-with-the-bedford-template.html"
,,Font self-hosting,3,1,1,0,"Load page immediately without blocking request for fonts. Kyle pretty much wrote the book on self-hosting fonts, so it's not surprising we're head and shoulders above here: https://www.bricolage.io/typefaces-easiest-way-to-self-host-fonts/"
Developer Experience,Maintenance & Extensibility,Serverless,3,3,2,2,Hosted is not quite as good as serverless -- they still have a server you just don't see it.
,,Export as Code,3,3,3,0,Site builders have platform lock-in; you can't take your code and run
,Faster edit/debug cycle time,Refresh or link to preview,3,3,3,3,Preview Mode is a pretty universal experience
,,Hot reload content,3,2,1,N/A,"You can see the content, but not in context of the page"
