title: Managing Pull Requests

## Pull Requests and the Community

Gatsby is an open source project. We have over 2,000 contributors and so much of what makes Gatsby great is contributed by folks like you!

Needless to say, we get a lot of PRs and we've been merging over a [100 contributions](https://twitter.com/kylemathews/status/1111435640581689345) every week. Yes, _every week_.

Let's talk a little about how we manage pull requests in the Gatsby repo!

## What is a Pull Request?

In case you aren't familiar, here is how the fine folks at GitHub [define a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests):

> Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.

Simply put, when someone wants to contribute to Gatsby, they open a request to _pull_ their code into ours. Depending on the type of change, we like to categorise pull requests (or PRs for short) into:

- Documentation
- Code
- Starters or Site Showcase
- Blog posts

When looking at a PR for the first time, it can help to read up on linked issues or RFCs (if there are any) to gain context on what the PR intends to add or fix.

> ðŸ’¡ If there isn't already an issue that describes the problem a PR is trying to solve, it can be helpful to open one. This helps in sharing context and can be very valuable in the future.

Each kind of PR requires a different set of checks from us before they are merged in!

Let's go over them real quick.

### Documentation

We typically look for the following in PRs that add documentation:

- Correctness â€” whether the added documentation is technically correct
- Style â€” whether the written language follows our [style guide](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/contributing/gatsby-style-guide/)

### Code

For PRs that add code (whether a feature or fix), we look for the following:

- Correctness â€” whether the code does what we think it does
- Tests â€” when fixing a bug or adding a new feature, it can be very valuable to add tests. While we do merge some small PRs without them, more often than not, it's good to have tests asserting behaviour! This can be a combination of unit tests for the specific package, snapshot tests and end to end tests. The goal here is to ensure that something that is being fixed or added _remains_ fixed or working the way we expect it to. Good tests ensure this!
- Code Quality â€” while it isn't good to nit pick, reasonable changes that improve readability are great to point out

### Starters or Site Showcase

For PRs that add a site or a starter to the showcase, we ought to check:

- Links â€” check if the links are working and accessible
- Tags â€” ensure the tags are not arbitrary
- Featured â€” for the site showcase, we like to default to _not_ featuring a site and typically someone from the Gatsby team features it later if they like!

### Blog posts

We typically look for the following in PRs that add documentation:

- Correctness â€” whether the added documentation is technically correct
- Style â€” whether the written language follows our [style guide](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/contributing/gatsby-style-guide/)

## Checks You Should Wait On/Fix

- [https://www.gatsbyjs.org/contributing/docs-contributions/#docs-site-setup-instructions](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/contributing/docs-contributions/#docs-site-setup-instructions)
- List all checks and what's required for your type of PR (from previous block)

(When we talk about linting checks â€” CTA to fix it maybe)

## Linting

- Document what commands to run
- Installing prettier and other tools

## Verifying a Pull Request

### Recommended

General points about quality, security vulnerabilities, accessibility, tests

- Verify links work
- Links ought to be relative
- Documentation in README if you're adding something
- Test the feature locally
  - (Side note: link to another doc?)
  - [https://www.gatsbyjs.org/contributing/setting-up-your-local-dev-environment/](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/contributing/setting-up-your-local-dev-environment/)
  - Talk about gatsby-dev-cli (and how that helps in testing out changes in a package in the monorepo)
  - [https://www.gatsbyjs.org/contributing/code-contributions/#using-docker-to-set-up-test-environments](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/contributing/code-contributions/#using-docker-to-set-up-test-environments)

### Nice to have

- PRs get squashed so individual commit messages are not important (but helpful anyway) but do this to [https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.3/](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.3/)))

## Giving Feedback

- Be kind/nice/empathetic
- Suggest using GitHub suggestions if possible (super easy to commit, you can batch them)
- Point to links/examples if possible
- Maintain context and scope (try not to bike shed too much)
- Note when something is optional/required
- Be objective and limit nitpicks (a few are fine if they add value or improve quality)

## Rights and Permissions

- When can you review? Should people comment on PRs that are WIP/Draft
  - Marcy thinks having a go ahead from the author is a good thing to wait for
  - [ ] Add details about being invited after your first contribution and what that allows one to do
  - [ ] Talk to the Core Team
- Who can review?
  - Everyone!
- Who can approve/merge?
  - CODEOWNERS / core team

## Gotchas

- While it's nice to help out and fix merge conflicts or linting issues, you might not be able to push to the author's fork and that's okay!
