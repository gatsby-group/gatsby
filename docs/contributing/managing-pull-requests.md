title: Managing Pull Requests
---

## Introduction

Talk about how Gatsby is a community project. Massively supported by the community. We get a lot of PRs (talk about activity cadence).

Read up on linked issues or RFC (if there are any) so that you have enough context on the feature or fix (or other proposed situations).

(If there isn't an issue already, it's nice to open one for historical purposes and to share context)

## What is a Pull Request?

Define it in plain English (since folks reading this could be new to this)

Categorise PRs into

- Docs
- Code
- Starters etc
- Marketing (blog post)

## Style Guide (Call out)

This can be a short call out

(Also applies to code an auxiliary text around code like a description in a PR or README)

## Checks You Should Wait On/Fix

- [https://www.gatsbyjs.org/contributing/docs-contributions/#docs-site-setup-instructions](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/contributing/docs-contributions/#docs-site-setup-instructions)
- List all checks and what's required for your type of PR (from previous block)

(When we talk about linting checks â€” CTA to fix it maybe)

## Linting

- Document what commands to run
- Installing prettier and other tools

## Verifying a Pull Request

### Recommended

General points about quality, security vulnerabilities, accessibility, tests

- Verify links work
- Links ought to be relative
- Documentation in README if you're adding something
- Test the feature locally
  - (Side note: link to another doc?)
  - [https://www.gatsbyjs.org/contributing/setting-up-your-local-dev-environment/](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/contributing/setting-up-your-local-dev-environment/)
  - Talk about gatsby-dev-cli (and how that helps in testing out changes in a package in the monorepo)
  - [https://www.gatsbyjs.org/contributing/code-contributions/#using-docker-to-set-up-test-environments](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/contributing/code-contributions/#using-docker-to-set-up-test-environments)

### Nice to have

- PRs get squashed so individual commit messages are not important (but helpful anyway) but do this to [https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.3/](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.3/)))

## Giving Feedback

- Be kind/nice/empathetic
- Suggest using GitHub suggestions if possible (super easy to commit, you can batch them)
- Point to links/examples if possible
- Maintain context and scope (try not to bike shed too much)
- Note when something is optional/required
- Be objective and limit nitpicks (a few are fine if they add value or improve quality)
