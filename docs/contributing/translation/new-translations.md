title: Starting a New Translation
---

This page lists the steps to take to create a a new Gatsbyjs.org translation.

## Creating a translation

### Read the maintainer guide

Before requesting a new translation, make sure to read the [maintainer guide](/contributing/translation/maintainers/) to affirm that you accept the responsibilities of being a translation maintainer.

### Check other issues

Before creating a new issue, make sure to check the list of [open translation requests](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+%22New+Translation+Request%22). If one already exists for your language, ask to be added to the list of maintainers there.

### Create a translation request issue

If you don't see the language among the issues listed, feel free to create a new [translation request issue](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/new?template=new_translation.md) for it and follow the instructions.

### Finding codeowners

For a new translation, open an issue with information about your intended language. If you already have co-contributors to act as fellow [code owners](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-code-owners) and provide checks and balances for PR reviews and quality assurance, that would be very helpful! Otherwise, you can check out other [translation request issues](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+%22New+Translation+Request%22) people have made and offer to join, or [get in touch with us](/contributing/how-to-contribute/#not-sure-how-to-start-contributing) at Gatsby for help in building your translation team.
