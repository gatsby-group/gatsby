title: Translation Maintainer Guide
---

This page lists the responsibilities of translation maintainers and provides tips on how to better manage your repository.

## Maintainer responsibilities

As repo maintainers and members of the Gatsby community, your responsibilities are as follows:

- Keep issues up-to-date as people volunteer to translate pages.
- Review pull requests made by contributors promptly.
- [Review pull requests generated by gatsbybot](/contributing/translation/sync-guide/) in order to make sure translations remain up-to-date with the source repo. (details to come)
- Act as point of contact for your language and answer questions from both contributors to your language and the core Gatsby team.
- Set up a process in order to get your translation published. (details to come)

As a maintainer, you are welcome to add a contributing doc written in your language to assist with the process. You can find an example in the [gatsby-es repo](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-es/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.MD). Translating [this page](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/master/docs/contributing/gatsby-docs-translation-guide.md) and copying it into a `contributing.md` file would be an option as well.

## Tips

### Set up a style guide and glossary

Your language repo comes with a template [style guide](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-i18n-source/blob/master/style-guide.md) that you can use to put in style rules specific to your language. Refer to the [translation style guide](#translation-style-guide) section for more information.

### Set up a review process

As codeowners, you have the freedom and responsibility to decide what your review process will be like. You can decide how many reviewers you'd like. If your team is small, one reviewer may be enough. But if you have lots of contributors and enough codeowners, you may want to require two reviewers for additional quality.

You have the ability to install any plugin or automation tool that will make your life easier as codeowners. Is there a text linter that works well in your language? Is there any automation that you can add? If you feel that these improvements would be beneficial to other languages as well, create an issue or PR for it in the main Gatsby repository.

### Ask for help

Don't be afraid to ask for help! If you're not sure about something, you can post in the `#localization` channel on the [Gatsby Discord](https://gatsby.dev/discord) or create an issue in the Gatsby repo.

If it feels like there is too much work and you need help, you have the ability to to add more codeowners by editing the `CODEOWNERS` file in the repo. Are there any contributors who are making exceptional contributions? If so, consider making them a codeowner.

We also understand that life sometimes gets in the way. If you find that you are no longer able to satisfy your codeowner duties, let the Gatsby team know so we can figure out the best path forward.

### Spread the word!

If you're finding it hard to find people to help translate, spread the word about your translation effort! If you use social media like Twitter, tag the [gatsby Twitter account](https://twitter.com/gatsbyjs) and we'll share it. Ask people in local Gatsby or React meetups if they would be interested in contributing.

## When a maintainer or contributor will be removed

Consistent with the [Code of Conduct](/docs/code-of-conduct/) the Gatsby team reserves the right to remove a maintainer (or contributor) from the Gatsby organization if necessary. Some reasons for being removed include spammy comments, closing PRs or issues without action or productive dialogue,or generally harmful or abusive behavior inconsistent with Gatsby's policies.

## Template responses for closing PRs

Sometimes a PR has a valid reason to not be merged as-is. Templates can help speed up the process of responding to someone while encouraging future contributions.

### PRs with quality issues

If a PR includes content that is of poor quality (such as from Google Translate or missing important nuance) or doesn't meet the requirements, it would help to include a drafted reply to encourage contributors to continue with the project. Here is an example that can be translated for a given repo:

```text
Hey! Thanks so much for opening a pull request!

We really appreciate you sending this over, but the change youâ€™ve proposed is not going to be accepted because it doesn't meaningfully translate the Gatsby docs content.

We absolutely want to have you as a contributor, so please take a look at [our open issues][open-issues] for ideas and reach out to the Gatsby team [on Twitter at @gatsbyjs](https://twitter.com/gatsbyjs) with questions.

Thanks again, and we look forward to seeing more PRs from you in the future! ðŸ’ªðŸ’œ
[open-issues]: YOUR_REPO_ISSUE_URL_HERE
```

### PRs with changes more fitting for the main Gatsby repo

Because the main Gatsby repo is the source of content, more substantive changes should be closed and redirected there. Here is a template that could be translated for your repo:

```text
Hey! Thanks so much for opening a pull request!

We really appreciate you sending this over, but the change youâ€™ve proposed is not going to be accepted because it includes broad changes to the docs content that should be done in the [main Gatsby repo](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) instead.

We absolutely want to have you as a contributor, so please take a look at the original source for these changes and make them there first before translating. You can also visit [our open issues][open-issues] for ideas and reach out to the Gatsby team [on Twitter at @gatsbyjs](https://twitter.com/gatsbyjs) with questions.

Thanks again, and we look forward to seeing more PRs from you in the future! ðŸ’ªðŸ’œ
