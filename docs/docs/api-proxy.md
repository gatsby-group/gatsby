title: "Proxying API Requests in Development"
---

People often serve the front-end React app from the same host and port as their
backend implementation.

To tell the development server to proxy any unknown requests to your API server
in development, add a `proxy` field to your `gatsby-config.js`, for example:

```js
module.exports = {
  proxy: {
    prefix: "/api",
    url: "http://dev-mysite.com",
  },
}
```

This way, when you `fetch('/api/todos')` in development, the development server
will recognize that itâ€™s not a static asset, and will proxy your request to
`http://dev-mysite.com/api/todos` as a fallback.

If you want to configure rewrite rules (say for testing Netlify functions locally), pass a `pathRewrite` object to the proxy config.

```js
module.exports = {
  proxy: {
    prefix: "/.netlify/functions",
    url: "http://localhost:9000",
    pathRewrite: { "/.netlify/functions": "" },
  },
}
```

Keep in mind that `proxy` only has effect in development (with `gatsby develop`), and it is up to you to ensure that URLs like `/api/todos` point to
the right place in production.
