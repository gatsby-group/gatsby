Unified Hosting (as signalled by a `gatsbyjs.io` domain) is enabled by default on production builds. However, if you'd like to take advantage of Unified Hosting on Pull Request and Preview builds, you must enable the build feature in Gatsby Cloud.

## Benefits

Unified Hosting on Gatsby Cloud provides several benefits to your site:

- Password protection
- More accurate Lighthouse reports
- Faster initial page loads (as well as being on a CDN)
- Better route caching for browser speed
- Unlimited redirects
- Reverse proxy behavior

## Enable Unified Hosting for All Builds

Unified Hosting for all builds (including Pull Requests and Previews) is currently available behind a toggle in the "Build feautres" section of the Gatsby Cloud dashboard.

Enable the "Unified Hosting" checkbox in Gatsby Cloud to take advantage of these benefits.
