<!-- Basic template for a Gatsby recipe:

## Task to accomplish.
1-2 sentences about it. The more concise and focused, the better!

### Prerequisites
- System/version requirements
- Everything necessary to set up the task
- Including setting up accounts at other sites, like Netlify
- See [docs templates](/docs/docs-templates/) for formatting tips

### Directions
Step-by-step directions. Each step should be repeatable and to-the-point. Anything not critical to the task should be omitted.

#### Live example (optional)
A live example may not be possible depending on the nature of the recipe, in which case it is fine to omit.

### Additional resources
- Tutorials
- Docs pages
- Plugin READMEs
- etc.

See [docs templates](/docs/docs-templates/) in the contributing docs for more help.

Craving a happy medium between [full-length tutorials](/tutorial/) and crawling the [docs](/docs/)? Here's a cookbook of guiding recipes on how to build things, Gatsby style.

## [1. Pages and layouts](/docs/recipes-pages-layouts)

Add pages to your Gatsby site, and use layouts to manage common page elements.

## [2. Styling with CSS](/docs/recipes-styling-css)

There are so many ways to add styles to your website; Gatsby supports almost every possible option, through official and community plugins.

## [3. Working with starters](/docs/recipes-working-with-starters)

[Starters](/docs/starters/) are boilerplate Gatsby sites maintained officially, or by the community.

## [4. Working with themes](/docs/recipes-working-with-themes)

A Gatsby theme lets you centralize the look-and-feel of your site. You can seamlessly update a theme, compose themes together, and even swap out one compatible theme for another.

## [5. Sourcing data](/docs/recipes-sourcing-data)

Pull data from multiple locations, like the filesystem or database, into your Gatsby site.

## [6. Querying data](/docs/recipes-querying-data)

Gatsby lets you access your data across all sources using a single GraphQL interface.

## [7. Working with images](/docs/recipes-working-with-images)

Access images as static resources, or automate the process of optimizing them through powerful plugins.

## [8. Transforming data](/docs/recipes-transforming-data)

Transforming data in Gatsby is plugin-driven. Transformer plugins take data fetched using source plugins, and process it into something more usable (e.g. JSON into JavaScript objects, and more).

## [9. Deploying your site](/docs/recipes-deploying-your-site)

Showtime. Once you are happy with your site, you are ready to go live with it!
