<!-- Basic template for a Gatsby recipe:

## Task to accomplish.
1-2 sentences about it. The more concise and focused, the better!

### Prerequisites
- System/version requirements
- Everything necessary to set up the task
- Including setting up accounts at other sites, like Netlify
- See [docs templates](/docs/docs-templates/) for formatting tips

### Directions
Step-by-step directions. Each step should be repeatable and to-the-point. Anything not critical to the task should be omitted.

#### Live example (optional)
A live example may not be possible depending on the nature of the recipe, in which case it is fine to omit.

### Additional resources
- Tutorials
- Docs pages
- Plugin READMEs
- etc.

See [docs templates](/docs/docs-templates/) in the contributing docs for more help.
