# What is GraphQL?

GraphQL is a query language for requesting information from an [API](/docs/glossary#api). It's one of the ways that you can import data into your Gatsby components.

Like [React](/docs/glossary/react.md), GraphQL is an open source product from Facebook.



* Send a string request.

  * Uses a GraphQL-specific syntax that resembles -- but is not JavaScript

* GraphQL server returns JSON as the response

* GraphQL is sort of a mediating layer between the API and where data is stored.

  * Data can be stored anywhere, in almost any form, including as Markdown-formatted text files or database servers.
  * GraphQL runtime fetches data from where its stored and turns it into a JSON-formatted response.
* In Gatsby, plugins do the work of converting Markdown into JSON.
