Learn what a Headless CMS is, how it differs from traditional content management systems, and why you might use one with Gatsby.

## What is a Headless CMS?

A content management system, or CMS, is a form of software that lets you create, edit, store, and publish text, images, and video or audio for your website.

1. In content management systems such as WordPress and Drupal, the frontend and backend are part of the same monolithic package.
2. Headless CMS separates the presentation from the content. Typically makes the content available as XML or JSON for a front end to consume and display.
3. Allows content team to use a familiar interface and a tool they already use for creating and managing content.
4. Allows content to be served to multiple front-ends &mdash; your Gatsby-powered site, or your mobile application, and social media channels.
