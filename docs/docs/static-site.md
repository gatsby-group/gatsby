# What is a static site?

There is often confusion around what is meant by a static site and how this is different from a "web app". The word "static" in this case does refer to the user experience, but rather to how the site is served. With a static site, the HTML for every possible route (or url) is generated *at build time*, whereas for non-static sites, the HTML is generated fresh every time it is requested aka. at *run-time*, either on the server ("server-rendered") or on the client ("client-rendered").
