The introductory paragraph should be a 1-2 sentence explanation of the main
topic and answer the following question:

What is the purpose of this guide?

## Prerequisites (if any)

If applicable, list any prerequisites to reading and understanding your article. Does the reader need to read another document first, install a particular plugin, or already know a certain skill? List those things here.

## The facts

What are the facts you know about the topic of this guide?

Keep paragraphs short (around 1-4 sentences). People are more likely to read
several short paragraphs instead of a huge block of text.

## Fonts and performance

Hosting your fonts within a project means your site will load faster. This increases your siteâ€™s speed by up to ~300 milliseconds on desktop and 1+ seconds on 3G connections.

**NOTE:** The Gatsby default starter project adds default font styling in the `layout.css` file.
