There are many ways to style your website, that can be grouped in two main approaches:

- **Cascading styles**: styles _cascade_ according to the CSS priority scheme. The rules with the highest priority control the content rendering.
- **Scoped styles**: CSS rules are scoped locally by default, to avoid unintended side-effects elsewhere. Scoped CSS comes in different flavors, from CSS Modules to CSS-in-JS libraries.

Gatsby doesn't have an opinion about which styling approach you choose. In doubt, a good starting point is to use traditional CSS files, as they'll seem familiar and don't require any third-party libraries.
