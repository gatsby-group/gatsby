There are many ways to style your website, that can be grouped in three main approaches:

- **Global CSS Files**: the traditional way to style a website. CSS rules are declared globally and styles are applied depending on specificity and inheritance.
- **Modular Stylesheets**: CSS rules are scoped locally to avoid unintended side-effects elsewhere. Works out-of-the-box with Gatsby.
- **CSS-in-JS**: locally-scoped CSS written in JavaScript, enabling the easier use of dynamic styling and other features. Requires the use of third-party libraries.

Gatsby doesn't have an opinion about which styling approach you choose. Almost every possible option is supported through official and community plugins. (If there isnâ€™t a plugin yet for your favorite option, consider contributing one!)
