The Gatsby CLI tool lets you install **starters**, which are boilerplate Gatsby sites maintained by the community and intended for jump-starting development quickly.

## Installing starters

To clone a boilerplate starter, install its dependencies, and clear Git history, execute the `gatsby new` command.

When creating a new site, you can optionally specify a starter to base your new site on. You can supply the `[URL_OF_STARTER_GITHUB_REPO]` directly:

```shell
gatsby new [SITE_DIRECTORY] [URL_OF_STARTER_GITHUB_REPO]
```

You can also supply a GitHub user name and repository:

```shell
gatsby new [SITE_DIRECTORY] [GITHUB_USER_NAME/REPO]
```

For example, to quickly create a blog using Gatsby, you could install the Gatsby Starter Blog by running:

```shell
gatsby new blog https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog
```

This downloads the files and initializes the site by running `npm install`.

Alternatively, you can use the `[GITHUB_USER_NAME/REPO]` format:

```shell
gatsby new blog gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog
```

If you don't specify a custom starter, your site will be created from the [default starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default).

> Learn [how to make a starter](/docs/creating-a-starter/) in the Gatsby docs. Starters can be created for your team(s) only or distributed to the broader community. It's up to you!
