Welcome to `gatsby@5.0.0` release (November 2022 #1).

Gatsby 5 introduces the Slices API and Partial Hydration (Experimental). Slices unlock up to 90% reduction in build duration for content changes in highly shared components, Partial Hydration allows you to ship only the necessary JavaScript to the browser.
Weâ€™ve tried to make migration smooth. Please refer to the [migration guide](/docs/reference/release-notes/migrating-from-v4-to-v5/)
and [let us know](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/new/choose) if you encounter any issues when migrating.
