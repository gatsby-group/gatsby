## Gatsby is joining Netlify

**Gatsby as a framework will continue to evolve and grow.** Weâ€™ve always shared with Netlify a mutual commitment to open-source and have never been more excited about Gatsbyâ€™s future. Many of Gatsbyâ€™s core contributors will join Netlify and continue to maintain the Gatsby framework.
