## `trailingSlash` Config Option

`gatsby-config.js` now supports a `trailingSlash` configuration with the three main options:

- `always`: Always add trailing slashes to each URL, e.g. `/x` to `/x/`.
- `never`: Remove all trailing slashes on each URL, e.g. `/x/` to `/x`.
- `ignore`: Don't automatically modify the URL

See [the docs page](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-config/#trailingslash) for more information.
