## `trailingSlash` Config Option

`gatsby-config.js` now supports a `trailingSlash` configuration with the three main options:

- `always`: Always add trailing slashes to each URL, e.g. `/x` to `/x/`.
- `never`: Remove all trailing slashes on each URL, e.g. `/x/` to `/x`.
- `ignore`: Don't automatically modify the URL

See [the docs page](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-config/#trailingslash) for more information.

## Faster Schema creation and createPages

We've seen a handful of sites struggling with long "schema building" and "createPages" steps. In this release, we've upgraded our external graphql-compose dependency to v9 to improve these steps by at least 30-50% for schemas/queries with many relationships. For example, one of our customers dropped from a createPages of 786s to 20s.
