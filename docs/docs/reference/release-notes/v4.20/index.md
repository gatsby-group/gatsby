## RFC for changes in `sort` and aggregation fields in Gatsby GraphQL Schema

We are proposing Breaking Changes for next major version of Gatsby to our GraphQL API with goal of increasing performance and redusing resource usage of builds. Proposed changes impact `sort` and aggregation fields (`group`, `min`, `max`, `sum`, `distinct`).

Basic example of proposed change:

Current:

```graphql
{
  allMarkdownRemark(sort: { fields: [frontmatter___date], order: DESC }) {
    nodes {
      ...fields
    }
  }
}
```

Proposed:

```jsx
{
  allMarkdownRemark(sort: { frontmatter: { date: DESC } }) {
    nodes {
      ...fields
    }
  }
}
```

To read more, head over to [RFC: Change to sort and aggregation fields API](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/discussions/36242). We appreciate any feedback there.

## Release Candidate for `gatsby-plugin-mdx` v4

In case you missed it: We're working on a new major version of `gatsby-plugin-mdx` to support MDX v2, improve build & frontend performance, and simplify the API.

You can now try out a release candidate version, head to the [MDX v2 RFC](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/discussions/25068) to learn more.
