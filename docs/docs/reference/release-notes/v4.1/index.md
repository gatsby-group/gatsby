## Support for Deferred Static Generation in File System Route API

With the introduction of Deferred Static Generation (DSG) ([What is DSG?](/blog/deferred-static-generation-guide)) you can defer non-critical page generation to the first user request. Currently, you can only achieve this by setting `defer: true` in the `createPage` action.

You're now also able to use DSG with [File System Route API](/docs/reference/routing/file-system-route-api/). For this we're introducing a new API inside File System Route templates that we'll continue to improve: A `config()` function. You'll be able to use it like this:

```jsx:title=src/pages/{MarkdownRemark.fields__slug}.jsx
import React from "react"
import { graphql } from "gatsby"

export default function Component(props) {
  return <pre>{JSON.stringify(props, null, 2)}</pre>
}

export async function config() {
  // Get all posts that were created before 2020-10-31
  const { data } = graphql`
    {
      oldPosts: allMarkdownRemark(
        filter: { frontmatter: { date: { lt: "2020-10-31" } } }
      ) {
        nodes {
          fields {
            slug
          }
        }
      }
    }
  `
  // Create a Set for easier comparison/lookup
  const oldPosts = new Set(data.oldPosts.nodes.map(n => n.fields.slug))

  // Return a function that when called will return a config for FS route pages
  // (right now only `defer` is supported)
  return ({ params }) => {
    return {
      // Defer pages older than 2020-10-31
      defer: oldPosts.has(params.fields__slug),
    }
  }
}

export const pageQuery = graphql`
  query BlogPost($id: String!) {
    markdownRemark(id: { eq: $id }) {
      html
      frontmatter {
        title
        date(formatString: "MMMM DD, YYYY")
        description
      }
    }
  }
`
```

In the async function `config()` you can use GraphQL to query the data layer you're used to. But you don't have to -- you can also use regular JavaScript or skip the outer function completely. `config()` must return a function itself in which you get `params` as an argument. `params` is the same object you also get as `props.params` in the page component (see [params documentation](/docs/reference/routing/file-system-route-api/#collection-route-components)), e.g. `src/pages/{Product.name}.js` has `params.name`.

Here's a minimal version of `config()` that defers every page of the current File System Route template:

```js
export async function config() {
  return ({ params }) => {
    return {
      defer: true,
    }
  }
}
```

You can read the [API reference](/docs/reference/routing/file-system-route-api#config-function) or the [DSG guide](/docs/how-to/rendering-options/using-deferred-static-generation/) to learn more.

**Please note:** As DSG has no effect in `gatsby develop` at the moment you can only test `config()` in `gatsby build` right now. As this is the first iteration of the `config()` API we're [looking for feedback](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/discussions/33789)!

## JSX Runtime Options in `gatsby-config.js`

You now can configure the `jsxRuntime` and `jsxImportSource` inside `gatsby-config.js`:

```js:title=gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  jsxRuntime: "automatic",
  jsxImportSource: "@emotion/react",
}
```

Setting `jsxRuntime` to `automatic` allows the use of JSX without having to import React (learn more in the [official blog post](https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-jsx-transform.html)). You can use the `jsxImportSource` option to set which package React should use as underlying JSX transformer.
