Welcome to `gatsby@4.0.0` release (October 2021 #1).

We've released Gatsby 3 in [March 2021](/docs/reference/release-notes/v3.0) and now have a lot of exciting new features for Gatsby 4!
Weâ€™ve tried to make migration smooth. Please refer to the [migration guide](/docs/reference/release-notes/migrating-from-v3-to-v4/)
and [let us know](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/new/choose) if you encounter any issues when migrating.

Key highlights of this release:

- [Parallel Query Running](#parallel-query-running) - up to 40% reduction in build times
- [Deferred Static Generation (DSG)](#deferred-static-generation-dsg) - defer page generation to user request, speeding up build times
- [Server-Side Rendering (SSR)](#server-side-rendering-ssr) - pre-render a page with data that is fetched when a user visits the page

Major dependency updates:

- [Node 14](#node-14)

Also check out [notable bugfixes and improvements](#notable-bugfixes-and-improvements).

**Bleeding Edge:** Want to try new features as soon as possible? Install `gatsby@next` and let us know
if you have any [issues](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues).

## Node 14

We are dropping support for Node 12 as a new underlying dependency (`lmdb-store`) is requiring `>=14.15.0`. See the main changes in [Node 14 release notes](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v14.0.0/).

Check [Nodeâ€™s releases document](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#nodejs-release-working-group) for version statuses.
