## `TRACED_SVG` support is removed

Due to licensing requirements, we are removing the `Potrace` library usage from Gatsby. `Potrace` was powering `TRACED_SVG` image placeholders generation.

As this removal might have implications, there will be no API-breaking changes. All of the image transformations will continue to work, however using tracedSVG features will now fall back to whatever the default method is - this is generally `DOMINANT_COLOR` for `gatsby-plugin-image` (`gatsbyImageData` and `gatsbyImage`).

Check https://gatsby.dev/tracesvg-removal/ for more information.
