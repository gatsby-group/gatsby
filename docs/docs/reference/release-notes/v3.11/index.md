## Improvements to Parallel Query Running

In case you missed it, in [3.10](/docs/reference/release-notes/v3.10) we've added experimental support for Parallel Query Running. Depending on your site you will see dramatic improvements in `gatsby build` performance. We've moved more information [into LMDB](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/32431), fixed a [bug](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/32520) and [optimized](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/32440) how we merge the state of the workers.

To learn more about Parallel Query Running head to the [previous release notes](/docs/reference/release-notes/v3.10/#experimental-parallel-query-running).

Please give it a try and report back in the [PQR GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/discussions/32389). We really appreciate any feedback!
