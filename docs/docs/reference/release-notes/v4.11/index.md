## `gatsby-source-shopify` v7

We released a new major version of `gatsby-source-shopify` ðŸŽ‰ Thanks to the work of our community member [Byron Hill](https://github.com/byronlanehill) the new version features a bunch of improvements:

- You can now query product videos or 3D models, in addition to product images.
- Variants, Images, etc. now keep the order in which you define them in the Shopify backend.
- Multiple metafield types were merged to one single metafield type (more alignment with Shopify's admin API schema).
- You can now query presentment prices.
- Explicit type definitions with disabled type inference. Or in other words: You can have no products in your store or a bunch of fields that are `null` without breaking your schema or builds.
- The API schema nearly matches the Shopify admin API schema which means that for the most part you can refer to Shopify's documentation.
