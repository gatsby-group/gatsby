Welcome to `gatsby@5.4.0` release (January 2023 #1)

The whole team took time off for a much deserved winter break and we hope you had relaxing holidays, too! Before the break we spent time doing maintenance work such as updating internal dependencies or fixing some smaller bugs here and there. In case you missed it, we shipped [ES Modules (ESM) in Gatsby files](/docs/reference/release-notes/v5.3#es-modules-esm-in-gatsby-files) in the last release.

So check out the [notable bugfixes](#notable-bugfixes--improvements) section to learn more.

**Bleeding Edge:** Want to try new features as soon as possible? Install `gatsby@next` and let us know if you have any [issues](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues).
