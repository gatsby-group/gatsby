## Performance Improvements

We're always working hard on making Gatsby faster. In this release we shipped three improvements:

- Speedup CLI startup by lazily requiring some modules. [PR #31134](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/31134)
- Create page object & `SitePage` node in same action creator. In our synthetic [create-pages](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/benchmarks/create-pages) benchmark (for 100K pages) this reduced the `createPages` activity from 16s to 4.5s (~70% drop) and peak RSS memory from 1.4gb to 0.7gb (~50% drop). [PR #31104](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/31104)
- Up to ~20% improvement to running queries by switching to a faster queue library ([fastq](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fastq). The improvements are most noticible if you use the fastest query filters (e.g. `eq` filter on the `id` property) and don't do CPU intensive work in query running e.g. process markdown or MDX. [PR #31269](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/31269)

## `gatsby-graphql-source-toolkit` v2

The [`gatsby-graphql-source-toolkit`](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-graphql-toolkit) simplifies data sourcing from remote GraphQL APIs into Gatsby. While it's not a source plugin by itself, it helps you writing custom GraphQL source plugins by providing a set of convenience tools and conventions. [Craft CMS](https://github.com/craftcms/gatsby-source-craft) or [GraphCMS](https://github.com/GraphCMS/gatsby-source-graphcms) use it for their source plugins.

The bump to a new major version ensures compatibility with `gatsby@^3.0.0`. No breaking changes were in this release.

## New SSR in Develop overlay

Previously the error overlay (when the page didn't successfully SSR) consisted out of a HTML page served by express. But that wasn't tied into our already existing [Fast Refresh](/docs/reference/local-development/fast-refresh/) overlay we use throughout Gatsby. The information on the page stays the same but it now has the look & feel of all our other errors:

![A modal showing that the page failed to SSR and showing a code block with the exact location of the error. Optionally you can reload the page or skip SSR rendering for now.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16143594/116409324-088a9e00-a834-11eb-8cf3-1c3745be8b51.png)
