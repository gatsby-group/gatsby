## Highlight Name

TODO

## Notable bugfixes, improvements, & changes

- `gatsby`:
  - TODO
- `gatsby-source-graphql`: we have "soft deprecated" this package in favor of other, CMS-specific source plugins
  - Note: You can continue to use this plugin for small sites or proof-of-concepts, but for larger sites backed by one or multiple CMSs we recommend using the official source plugin
  - [Read more on the README about the decision](https://gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-source-graphql) as well as the [pull request](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/36469)
