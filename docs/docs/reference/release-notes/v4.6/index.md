## Speeding Up Subsequent Queries

Subseqent queries now get ~10-15% performance boost! These percentage may defer depending on the complexity of nodes. We were able to achieve this by caching `rootNode` & `trackedRootNodes` across instances of `graphqlRunner` via [PR #33695](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/33695)

## Tracking Image Changes in Markdown Files

When using `gatsby-remark-images`, updating image files specified in markdown doesn't cause changes to reflect in the broswer, this was because images seen in markdown are not actually registered as node dependencies for the given page and you'll typically need to do a gatsby clean for changes to reflect. This is now fixed via [PR #34433 ](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/34433). Now you can update images and see them reflect on the fly

## Fix Plugin Schema Validation

For plugin authors, we fixed an issue that prevented default values from `pluginOptionsSchema` to be passed when consuming plugin options. This [issue](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/33033) is now fixed via [PR #34182](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/34182) This introduces some breaking changes:

- `pluginOptionsSchema` will give warnings instead of throw errors when a plugin receives an uknown configuration key
- `pluginOptionsSchema` will respect default configuration keys set with Joi
- `testPluginOptionsSchema` function will also return `hasWarnings` and `warnings` properties for use in test suites

## Notable Bugfixes & Improvements

`gatsby-plugin-manifest` generate icons sequentially via [PR #34331](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/34331)

- `create-gatsby`: Fixed issue where user-provided `GATSBY_TELEMETRY_DISABLED` environment variable did not disable telemetry, via [PR #34495](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/34495)
- `gatsby-sharp` - create more resilient wrapper around sharp via [PR #34339](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/34339)
- `gatsby-source-contentful` : enable tag support for assets via [PR #34480](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/34480)
- `gatsby` - move id.eq fast path handling to node-model so it's shared between query running strategies via [PR #34520](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/34520)
