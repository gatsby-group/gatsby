## Speeding Up Subsequent Queries

Walking nodes to track inline objects is very expensive. Caching this across instances of the graphql query sped up subsequent queries by ~10-15% (depending on complexity of nodes).

## Tracking Image Changes in Markdown Files

Images seen in markdown are not actually registered as node dependencies for the given page, this means that images won't get updated on the fly if the image content changes and the image name doesn't change.

## Fix Plugin Schema Validation

For plugin authors, we fixed an issue that prevented default values from `pluginOptionsSchema` to be passed when consuming plugin options. This [issue](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/33033) is now fixed via [#34182](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/34182) This introduces some breaking changes:

- `pluginOptionsSchema` will give warnings instead of throw errors when a plugin receives an uknown configuration key
- `pluginOptionsSchema` will respect default configuration keys set with Joi
- `testPluginOptionsSchema` function will also return `hasWarnings` and `warnings` properties for use in test suites
