## Notable Bugfixes & Improvements

- `gatsby-transform-remark` and `gatsby-remark-images`: Fixed caching issue where `gatsby-transformer-remark` would not reload image dependencies from `gatsby-remark-images` while running `gatsby develop`, via [PR #34433](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/34433)
- `gatsby-plugin-utils` fixes to plugin schema validation via [PR #34182](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/34182):
  - `pluginOptionsSchema` will give warnings instead of throw errors when a plugin receives an uknown configuration key
  - `pluginOptionsSchema` will respect default configuration keys set with Joi
  - `testPluginOptionsSchema` function will also return `hasWarnings` and `warnings` properties for use in test suites
- `create-gatsby`: Fixed issue where user-provided `GATSBY_TELEMETRY_DISABLED` environment variable did not disable telemetry, via [PR #34495](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/34495)
