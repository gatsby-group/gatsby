Welcome to `gatsby@2.30.0` release (January 2021 #1)

Key highlights of this release:

- [Query on Demand and Lazy Images: Generally available](#query-on-demand-and-lazy-images-generally-available) - improves `gatsby develop` bootup time
- [gatsby-plugin-sass v3](#gatsby-plugin-sass300) - use the latest `sass-loader` and `Dart Sass` by default

And several impactful updates in the new [`gatsby-plugin-image`](#gatsby-plugin-image050-beta) (beta):

- [AVIF support](#avif-support) - enjoy next-gen image format
- [Support remote static images](#support-static-image-urls-experimental) - download, transform and optimize remote images with a single line
- [New defaults](#new-defaults) - less configuration for most common image setups

Also check out [notable bugfixes](#notable-bugfixes).

[Full changelog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/compare/gatsby@2.30.0-next.0...gatsby@2.30.0)

## Query on Demand and Lazy Images: Generally Available

Those two features change the way how `gatsby develop` works:

- We no longer transform all images eagerly on dev server start
- We no longer run all queries

Instead, it happens lazily when the browser requests a page or a specific image variant.
This significantly shortens the boot-up time for `gatsby develop`.

> Note that it does not affect `gatsby build` in any way, only `gatsby develop`

We've been gradually rolling out those features:

- "Query on Demand" was introduced behind the flag in [v2.27](/docs/reference/release-notes/v2.27#experimental-queries-on-demand).
- "Lazy images" were introduced behind the flag in [gatsby-plugin-sharp@2.10.0](/docs/reference/release-notes/v2.28#experimental-lazy-images-in-develop).
- In [v2.29](/docs/reference/release-notes/v2.29#queries-on-demand) 10% of our users were automatically opted-in

This allowed us to collect the feedback and fix bugs as they were discovered.

Now we feel confident enough to publish it as generally available. You don't need to add flags or any environment
variables to enable it. Just upgrade to `gatsby@2.30.0` (and `gatsby-plugin-sharp@2.12.0` for lazy images).

In v2.29 we improved the UX around long-running queries by adding a loading indicator and message to the browser console (only in `gatsby develop`). If you want or need to de-activate this indicator, you can! For more details please see the [umbrella discussion](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/discussions/27620).

## gatsby-plugin-sass@3.0.0

Now that [LibSass and Node Sass are deprecated](https://sass-lang.com/blog/libsass-is-deprecated), we've
upgraded `sass-loader` to `10.1.0` and thus switched sass implementation to [Dart Sass](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass).

The plugin itself is compatible with the previous version. For the majority of projects the upgrade
won't require any special actions.

But keep in mind that **Dart Sass** may still have subtle differences in some edge cases comparing to **Node Sass**,
so if you encounter any issues make sure to check out ["How do I migrate section"](https://sass-lang.com/blog/libsass-is-deprecated#how-do-i-migrate) in sass docs.

## gatsby-plugin-image@0.5.0 (beta)

### AVIF support

This release adds beta support for generating and displaying [AVIF images](https://netflixtechblog.com/avif-for-next-generation-image-coding-b1d75675fe4). AVIF is a brand new image format, which offers considerably better filesizes and quality than JPG and even WebP. It is currently [only supported in Chrome](https://caniuse.com/avif), with Firefox support coming soon. However it is safe to use today, because unsupported browsers will fall back to using a supported format.

AVIF is not currently enabled by default, so to use it in your site you need to add it to the `formats` array. You should also include auto and WebP to support other browsers. Ensure that you have upgraded to the latest version of `gatsby-plugin-sharp`, `gatsby-transformer-sharp` and `gatsby-plugin-image`, and then use the following syntax:

In `StaticImage`:

```jsx
<StaticImage
  src="./cornwall.jpg"
  formats={["auto", "webp", "avif"]}
  alt="Cornwall"
/>
```

...or in GraphQL:

```graphql
query {
  file(relativePath: { eq: "cornwall.jpg" }) {
    childImageSharp {
      gatsbyImageData(maxWidth: 720, formats: [AUTO, WEBP, AVIF])
    }
  }
}
```

This is possible thanks to the incredible work by the [sharp](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/) and [libvips](https://libvips.github.io/libvips/) contributors.

### Support remote image URLs (experimental)

This release enables experimental support for remote URLs in the `StaticImage` component. This means that you can pass an absolute URL in the `src` prop and Gatsby will download the file and process it at build time. It is currently experimental, but you can try it out today and let us know how you find it.

To enable, set the `GATSBY_EXPERIMENTAL_REMOTE_IMAGES` environment variable to `1` when building:

```shell
GATSBY_EXPERIMENTAL_REMOTE_IMAGES=1 gatsby develop
```

or...

```shell
GATSBY_EXPERIMENTAL_REMOTE_IMAGES=1 gatsby build
```

You can then pass absolute URLs to `StaticImage`:

```js
<StaticImage src="https://placekitten.com/400/400" alt="Kittin" />
```

Please note that this is only supported in `StaticImage`.
