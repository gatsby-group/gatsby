## Better UX for navigation in the middle of deployment

This release solves a common UX problem with navigation in the middle of deployment.
Imagine the following scenario:

1. Users loads a page
2. New version of the site is deployed
3. User tries to navigate to another page with `gatsby-link`

However, nothing happens and there are some JS errors in the console.

It happens because paths of JS chunks change with the new deployment and so the old chunks cannot be found.
This problem is now addressed in Gatsby automatically. Once we spot this error, the page is hard-reloaded for the user.

This was one of the most [upvoted issues](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/18866) in our repo.
See [PR #33032](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/33032) for details.

## New developer tools

### `createPages` snippet in GraphiQL

Often, a developer will begin creating the site by examining their data layer in GraphiQL. They will then want to create pages based off of their initial query. For example:

```graphql
query MyQuery {
  allContentfulBlogPosts {
    nodes {
      id
      slug
    }
  }
}
```

Usually this will end up with this code in `gatsby-node.js`:

```javascript
const path = require(`path`)

exports.createPages = async ({ graphql, actions }) => {
  const { createPage } = actions

  const result = await graphql(`
    {
      allContentfulBlogPosts {
        nodes {
          id
          slug
        }
      }
    }
  `)
  const templatePath = path.resolve(`PATH/TO/TEMPLATE.js`)

  result.data.allContentfulBlogPosts.nodes.forEach(node => {
    createPage({
      path: NODE_SLUG,
      component: templatePath,
      context: {
        slug: NODE_SLUG,
      },
    })
  })
}
```

Doing it manually is tedious, but now you can generate this snippet from GraphiQL
and paste to `gatsby-node.js`!

See [PR #32968](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/32968) for details.

### Added GraphQL aggregation fields to group

Now you can apply `max`, `min`, `distinct`, `sum`, `group` to grouped nodes. In other words,
a query like this is now possible:

```graphql
{
  allMarkdown {
    group(field: frontmatter___authors___name) {
      fieldValue
      group(field: frontmatter___title) {
        fieldValue
        max(field: frontmatter___price)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

See [PR #32533](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/32533) for details.

## Preparations for gatsby v4

Actions used for schema customization should not be used in `sourceNodes` API anymore:
namely `createTypes`, `createFieldExtension` and `addThirdPartySchema`.

Usage of those actions in `sourceNodes` is deprecated as of this release and will break in [Gatsby v4](/gatsby-4/).

Also check out the [migration guide](#) (work in progress!) for other upcoming breaking changes and don't hesitate to
let us know what you think in [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/discussions/32860).
