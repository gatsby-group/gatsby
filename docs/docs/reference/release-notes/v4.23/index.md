## Open RFCs

### Slices API

We are adding a new API that we are calling ‚ÄúSlices‚Äù. By using a new `<Slice />` React component in combination with a `src/slices` directory or `createSlice` API for common UI features, Gatsby will be able to build and deploy individual pieces of your site that had content changes, not entire pages.

To create a slice, simply:

1. Create the slice by adding a `slices/footer.js` file, or using the `createPages` API action:

   ```js
   actions.createSlice({
     id: `footer`,
     component: require.resolve(`./src/components/footer.js`),
   })
   ```

2. Add a `<Slice />` component on your site, providing an `alias` string prop, where `alias` is either name of the file (in our case, `footer`). Any additional props passed will be handed down to the underlying component.

   ```jsx
   return (
     <>
       <Header className="my-header" />
       {children}
       <Slice alias="footer" />
     </>
   )
   ```

### Changes in `sort` and aggregation fields in Gatsby GraphQL Schema

We are proposing Breaking Changes for the next major version of Gatsby to our GraphQL API. The goal of this change is increasing performance and reducing resource usage of builds. Proposed changes impact `sort` and aggregation fields (`group`, `min`, `max`, `sum`, `distinct`).

Basic example of proposed change:

Current:

```graphql
{
  allMarkdownRemark(sort: { fields: [frontmatter___date], order: DESC }) {
    nodes {
      ...fields
    }
  }
}
```

Proposed:

```jsx
{
  allMarkdownRemark(sort: { frontmatter: { date: DESC } }) {
    nodes {
      ...fields
    }
  }
}
```
