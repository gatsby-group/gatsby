## `gatsby-plugin-mdx` v4

We're excited to announce [`gatsby-plugin-mdx`](/plugins/gatsby-plugin-mdx) v4! ðŸŽ‰ With the help of our contractor [axe312ger](https://github.com/axe312ger) we have rewritten the plugin from scratch to give you these new features:

- Full compatibility with [MDX 2](https://mdxjs.com/blog/v2/)
- Per-file tree shaking and chunking (No more `app.js` bundle bloat or global scope problems)
- Simplified usage in pages
- Simplified plugin options
- You can configure the underyling [`@mdx-js/mdx` compile](https://mdxjs.com/packages/mdx/#compilefile-options), e.g. to add `remark` or `rehype` plugins

Over the last couple of months we've been hard at work building a new version of `gatsby-plugin-mdx`. The PRs [#35650](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/35650) and [#35893](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/35893) are the culmination of these efforts.

It also can't be overstated that the complete rewrite from scratch allowed us to set up the plugin for easier maintenance in the future. While this isn't a particular exciting user-facing feature, from a maintainer's perspective this will be a huge benefit for any future upgrades we (or you, [the community](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/contributing)) want to make to `gatsby-plugin-mdx`.

`gatsby-plugin-mdx` v4 is ready for primetime and you can start using it now.

### Getting started

There are multiple ways on how you can get started with `gatsby-plugin-mdx` v4:

- Initialize a new project with `npm init gatsby` and choose the **"Add Markdown and MDX support"** option
- Follow the [Adding MDX pages](/docs/how-to/routing/mdx/) guide
- Follow our [beginner friendly tutorial](/docs/tutorial/) to learn how to create a blog with MDX
- Try out the [using-mdx example](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/examples/using-mdx)
- Fork this [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/examples/using-mdx)

The updated [`gatsby-plugin-mdx` README](/plugins/gatsby-plugin-mdx/) contains detailed instructions on any new options and APIs.

### Migrating from v3 to v4

If you're already using `gatsby-plugin-mdx` v3 and want to migrate, you can follow the [extensive migration guide](/plugins/gatsby-plugin-mdx#migrating-from-v3-to-v4) to benefit from all new features.

We did our best to strike a balance between introducing meaningful breaking changes and keeping old behaviors. For example, while a lot of people use GraphQL nodes like `timeToRead` or `wordCount`, over the years it has become increasingly hard to fulfill every feature request and behavior that users wanted (e.g. correctly providing `timeToRead`/`wordCount` for every language is hard). One the one hand removing default fields like these means that you have to reimplement them on your own, but on the other hand this also means that you can more granularly customize them to your needs. Read [Extending the GraphQL MDX nodes](/plugins/gatsby-plugin-mdx#extending-the-graphql-mdx-nodes) for guidance on how to migrate.

If you have any questions along the way, post them either into the [umbrella discussion](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/discussions/25068) or into the [`mdx-v2` channel on Discord](https://gatsby.dev/discord).

The [using-mdx example](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/examples/using-mdx) also showcases some of the necessary migration steps.
