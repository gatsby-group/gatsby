## ES6 Promises

When running on the browser, Gatsby makes use of the [Promise API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) so that plugins can run asynchronous code early on during bootstrap.

Because of this, Gatsby by default includes a Promise polyfill when building your site.  If you would like to provide your own promise implementation, you can set `polyfill` to `false` in your `gatsby-config.js`:

```
module.exports = {
    polyfill: false,
    // ...
}
```

## Browserslist

You may customize your list of supported browser versions by declaring a [`"browserslist"`](https://github.com/ai/browserslist) key within your `package.json`. Changing these values will modify your JavaScript (via [`babel-preset-env`](https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env#targetsbrowsers)) and your CSS (via [`autoprefixer`](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer)) output.

This article is a good introduction to the growing community around Browserslist â€” https://css-tricks.com/browserlist-good-idea/

By default, Gatsby emulates the following config:

 ```javascript
// package.json
{
  "browserslist": [
    "> 1%",
    "IE >= 9",
    "last 2 versions"
  ]
}
```
