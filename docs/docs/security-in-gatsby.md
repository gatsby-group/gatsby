title: Security in Gatsby
---

By being a modern static site generator, Gatsby inherits several security principles that comes with this approach. However, even with this, your users could be exposed to malicious attacks. In this page, you will see what they are and how you could prevent them.

## Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Cross-Site Scripting is a type of attack that injects a script or a unexpected link to another site into the client side of the application.

JSX elements automatically escapes HTML tags by design. So, when you try to inject them as the example below:

```js
// highlight-next-line
const username = `<script src='https://path/to/badness.js'></script>`

const User = () => <p> hello {username}</p>
```

it will render `hello <script src='https://path/to/badness.js'></script>` as a string inside the p tag.

In other hand, there could be some fields in your application that you will need to render the inner HTML tags, such as a content field in a blog or a comment in a comments section, that are built in rich-text editors.

That's when you expose your application to XSS attacks, since the way to render these HTML tags is by using a HTML parser (e.g. [html-react-parser](https://github.com/remarkablemark/html-react-parser)) or using the `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` prop, as this example below:

```js
const CommentRenderer = comment => (
  // highlight-next-line
  <p dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: comment }} />
) // dangerous indeed.
```

**How can it be prevented?**

The most straightforward way to prevent the XSS attack is to sanitize the innerHTML string before dangerously setting it. Fortunately, there are npm packages that does the job, like [sanitize-html](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sanitize-html) and [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify).

## Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

A web application that use cookies could be attacked by the CSRF exploit, which deceives a your user to execute actions by its name. By default, the browser "trusts" all the activity made validating the user's identity and therefore sending the associated cookies in every request.

For example, assume that your users received an email with a malicious link:

```html
<a href="http://maliciouswebsite.xyz/">Get your coupon here</a>
```

Then, when the website opens, it could render this tag:

```html
<img src="http://yourecommerce.com/profile" />
```

which, instead of rendering an image, it sends the request with the authentication cookies and opens a security breach in their personal information.

**How can it be prevented?**

This could be prevented in three major ways:

### Additional Session Token

In addition to cookie validation, another approach could be added in the flow, such as an [OAuth2](https://oauth.net/2/).

### Same-Site Cookies Directive

If you need to create cookies in your application, make sure to  protect them by adding the `SameSite` directive:

`Set-Cookie: example=1; SameSite=Strict`

It allows the server to make sure that the requests are not being sent by a **cross-site** domain.
Check out [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie) regarding how a cookie could be configurated. [Most moderns browsers support it with a backward compatibility](https://caniuse.com/#feat=same-site-cookie-attribute).

### Anti-CSRF Tokens

In addition to a form, a hidden input could be added, holding the value of a encrypted token generated by the serve when page loads. When the form is sent, the server can block the action if they are not the same.

## Third-party Scripts

Some third-party scripts like Google Tag Manager gives the possibility to add arbitrary JavaScript code on top of them as a [custom HTML tag](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6107167), which can be a malicious script. To avoid that, be sure to have a [access control](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6107011) management in these services.

## Check Your Dependencies

In your Gatsby project, you are going to have a lot of dependencies (which has their own dependencies as well) in your `node_modules/`. Therefore, it is important to check if any of them has a security issue. 

**Using `npm`**

In npm, you can use the `npm audit` command to check your dependencies. It is available since v6. Check their [docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/audit) for more options.

**Using `yarn`**

Similar to `npm`, you can use the `yarn audit` command. It is available since v1.12.0, not available in v2. Check their [docs](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/audit/) for more options.

## Content Security Policy (CSP)

Content Security Policy is a security layer added in web applications to detect and prevent attacks, e.g. the XSS attack mentioned above.

To add it to your Gatsby website, add [gatsby-plugin-csp](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-csp/) to your `gatsby-config.js` with the desired configuration. Note that
currently there is a [incompatibility issue](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/10890) between [gatsby-plugin-csp](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-csp/) and [gatsby-image](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-image) and other plugins that generate hashes in inline styles.

Note:  Not all browsers support CSP, check [can-i-use](https://caniuse.com/#feat=mdn-http_headers_csp_content-security-policy) for more information.
