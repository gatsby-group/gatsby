Getting your shiny new Gatsby site onto the cloud is probably the first thing you will want to do now that it's built! Also, give yourself a pat on the back real quick for creating something new!

When you run a Gatsby build, the output is static content: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images. This content is incredibly easy and affordable to host with any provider. We have several guides below for hosting with particular providers, but this list is by no means exhaustive. Whether you're deploying with AWS, Netlify, or something in between, switching to static content makes deploying a trivial concern. The only thing that youo need to care about are the [caching rules](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/caching/) for the best performance of your site.

In this section you'll find answers to questions about dealing with app routes that aren't at the root of your domain with `path prefixes`, as well as how to deploy to countless hosting solutions such as [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [AWS Amplify Console](https://console.amplify.aws), and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). As well as what's necessary to make sure you're fully prepared for a deploy! ðŸš€
