## What is accessibility ?

Back in the early days of the Web, Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, said:

> "The power of the Web is in its universality.
> Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect."

The web of today is an important resource in many aspects of life such as health care, education, or commerce. Accessibility is a topic you definitely want to address when building your site.

Web Accessibility means that sites are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them. But not only people with permanent disabilities benefit from it. Accessibility also benefits people with temporary disabilities. For example imagine being in a environment where you cannot listen to audio or if you had a broken arm.

From a human point of view, you want to be inclusive with every kind of people. Your conditions should not be a barrier.

From a business point of view, you want the highest amount of people using your products and services.

## Gatsby supports accessibility

One of the most common features of every site is navigation. People should be able to navigate across your pages and content in an intuitive and accessible way.

That's why every Gatsby site has an accessible navigation experience by default.

It is possible thanks to [@reach/router](https://reach.tech/router), a routing library for React, that provides focus management on page change. It also has a ~70% smaller bundle size than the famous [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router).

Since the [second major release](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2018-09-17-gatsby-v2/), your Gatsby sites use `@reach/router` under the hood. The [Gatsby Link Component](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-link/) wraps [@reach/router's Link component](https://reach.tech/router/api/Link), so you don't need to think about it.

Accessibility by default is a win for everyone. Gatsby wants to help you making accessible sites.
