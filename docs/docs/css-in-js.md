CSS-in-JS refers to a styling approach where styles are written in JavaScript instead of with external CSS files.

Note that this functionality is not a part of React or Gatsby, and requires using [CSS-in-JS third-party libraries](https://github.com/MicheleBertoli/css-in-js#css-in-js).

This section contains guides for styling your site with some of the most popular CSS-in-JS libraries.
