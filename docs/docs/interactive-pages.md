title: Interactive pages
---

One nice thing about using Gatsby for building websites vs. other tools is that itÊ¼s easier to add interactivity to your pages. React.js was designed for Facebook.com and is used on many other world-class web applications.

You start by creating a new link to a page at `/counter`/ from your original `index.js` page component `<Link to="/counter/">Counter</Link>`.

```jsx{13-15}
import React from "react"
import { Link } from "gatsby"

export default () =>
  <div style={{ color: `tomato` }}>
    <h1>Hello Gatsby!</h1>
    <p>What a world.</p>
    <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/random/400x200" alt="" />
    <br />
    <div>
      <Link to="/page-2/">Link</Link>
    </div>
    <div>
      <Link to="/counter/">Counter</Link>
    </div>
  </div>
```

Add that link, click on it, and then you need to create a "Hello World" page component for `/counter/`. But instead of using the "functional component" form as you did before, this time you'll create a "class" component at `src/pages/counter.js`.

```jsx
import React from "react"

class Counter extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <div>Hello Class Component</div>;
  }
}

export default Counter
```

The class form of React allows us to have component state. You'll need that for the counter.

Continuing to flesh out the counter, add two buttons: one to increment and one to decrement the count of the counter.

```jsx{5-12}
import React from "react"

class Counter extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Counter</h1>
        <p>current count: 0</p>
        <button>plus</button>
        <button>minus</button>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

export default Counter
```

Now you have everything you need to make a nice counter.

First, set up the component state.

```jsx{4-7,13}
import React from "react"

class Counter extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super()
    this.state = { count: 0 }
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Counter</h1>
        <p>current count: {this.state.count}</p>
        <button>plus</button>
        <button>minus</button>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

export default Counter
```

You're now rendering the current count from the component state.

Now you need to change the state when we click on our buttons.

```jsx{14-31}
import React from "react"

class Counter extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super()
    this.state = { count: 0 }
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Counter</h1>
        <p>current count: {this.state.count}</p>
        <button
          onClick={() =>
            this.setState(prevState => ({
              count: prevState.count + 1,
            }))
          }
        >
          plus
        </button>
        <button
          onClick={() =>
            this.setState(prevState => ({
              count: prevState.count - 1,
            }))
          }
        >
          minus
        </button>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

export default Counter
```

You got a working React.js counter inside your static website! ðŸ‘Œ
