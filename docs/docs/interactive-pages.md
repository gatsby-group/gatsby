title: Interactive pages
---

One nice thing about using Gatsby for building websites vs. other tools is that itÊ¼s easier to add interactivity to your pages. React.js was designed for
Facebook.com and is used on many other world-class web applications.

Let's see how to add interactive elements to our pages. Let's start with a counter.

We'll start by creating a new link to a page at `/counter`/ from our original
`index.js` page component `<Link to="/counter/">Counter</Link>`.

```jsx{13-15}
import React from "react"
import { Link } from "gatsby"

export default () =>
  <div style={{ color: `tomato` }}>
    <h1>Hello Gatsby!</h1>
    <p>What a world.</p>
    <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/random/400x200" alt="" />
    <br />
    <div>
      <Link to="/page-2/">Link</Link>
    </div>
    <div>
      <Link to="/counter/">Counter</Link>
    </div>
  </div>
```

Add that link, click on it, and then we'll create a "Hello World" page component
for `/counter/`. But instead of using the "functional component" form
as we did before, this time we'll create a "class" component at `src/pages/counter.js`.

```jsx
import React from "react"

class Counter extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <div>Hello Class Component</div>;
  }
}

export default Counter
```

The class form of React allows us to have component state. We'll need that for
our counter.

Let's continue to flesh out our counter. Let's add two buttons. One to increment
and one to decrement the count of the counter.

```jsx{5-12}
import React from "react"

class Counter extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Counter</h1>
        <p>current count: 0</p>
        <button>plus</button>
        <button>minus</button>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

export default Counter
```

Now we have everything we need to make a nice counter. Let's make it live.

First we'll set up the component state.

```jsx{4-7,13}
import React from "react"

class Counter extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super()
    this.state = { count: 0 }
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Counter</h1>
        <p>current count: {this.state.count}</p>
        <button>plus</button>
        <button>minus</button>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

export default Counter
```

We're now rendering the current count from the component state.

Let's now change the state when we click on our buttons.

```jsx{14-31}
import React from "react"

class Counter extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super()
    this.state = { count: 0 }
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Counter</h1>
        <p>current count: {this.state.count}</p>
        <button
          onClick={() =>
            this.setState(prevState => ({
              count: prevState.count + 1,
            }))
          }
        >
          plus
        </button>
        <button
          onClick={() =>
            this.setState(prevState => ({
              count: prevState.count - 1,
            }))
          }
        >
          minus
        </button>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

export default Counter
```

There you go! A working React.js counter inside your static website ðŸ‘Œ
