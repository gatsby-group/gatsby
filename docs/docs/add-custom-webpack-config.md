title: "Add custom web pack config"
---

_Before creating custom web pack configuration, check to see if there's a Gatsby
plugin already built that handles your use case in the
[plugins section](/docs/plugins/). If there's not yet one and your use case is a
a general one, we highly encourage you to contribute back your plugin to the
Gatsby Plugin Library so it's available to others (including your future self ðŸ˜€)._

To add custom web pack configurations, create (if there's not one already) a
`Gatsby-node.js` file in your root directory. Inside this file, export a
function called `onCreateWebpackConfig`.

When Gatsby creates its web pack config, this function will be called allowing
you to modify the default web pack config using
[webpack-merge](https://github.com/survivejs/webpack-merge).

Gatsby does multiple web pack builds with a somewhat different configuration. We
call each building type a "stage". The following stages exist:

1.  develop: when running the `gatsby developing` command. Has configuration for hot
    reloading and CSS injection into the page
2.  develop-HTML: same as developing but without react-hmre in the babel config for
    rendering the HTML component.
3.  build-javascript: production JavaScript and CSS build. Creates route JS bundles as well
    as commons chunks for JS and CSS.
4.  build-HTML: production build static HTML pages

Check
[webpack.config.js](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/master/packages/gatsby/src/utils/webpack.config.js)
for the source.

There are many plugins in the Gatsby repo using this API to look to for examples
e.g. [Sass](/packages/gatsby-plugin-sass/),
[TypeScript](/packages/gatsby-plugin-typescript/),
[Glamor](/packages/gatsby-plugin-glamor/), and many more!

## Examples

Here is an example adding an additional global variable via the `DefinePlugin` and the `less-loader`:

```js:title=gatsby-node.js
exports.onCreateWebpackConfig = ({
  stage,
  rules,
  loaders,
  plugins,
  actions,
}) => {
  actions.setWebpackConfig({
    module: {
      rules: [
        {
          test: /\.less$/,
          use: [
            // We don't need to add the matching ExtractText plugin
            // because gatsby already includes it and makes sure its only
            // run at the appropriate stages, e.g. not in development
            loaders.miniCssExtract(),
            loaders.css({ importLoaders: 1 }),
            // the postcss loader comes with some nice defaults
            // including autoprefixer for our configured browsers
            loaders.postcss(),
            `less-loader`,
          ],
        },
      ],
    },
    plugins: [
      plugins.define({
        __DEVELOPMENT__: stage === `develop` || stage === `develop-html`,
      }),
    ],
  })
}
```

### Absolute imports

Instead of writing `import Header from '../../components/header'` over and over again you can just write `import Header from 'components/header'` with absolute imports:

```js:title=gatsby-node.js
exports.onCreateWebpackConfig = ({ stage, actions }) => {
  actions.setWebpackConfig({
    resolve: {
      modules: [path.resolve(__dirname, "src"), "node_modules"],
    },
  })
}
```

You can always find more information on _resolve_ and other options in the official [Webpack docs](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/).

### Modifying the babel loader

You need this if you want to do things like transpile parts of `node_modules`.

```js:title=gatsby-node.js
exports.onCreateWebpackConfig = ({ actions, loaders, getConfig }) => {
  const config = getConfig()

  config.module.rules = [
    // Omit the default rule where test === '\.jsx?$'
    ...config.module.rules.filter(
      rule => String(rule.test) !== String(/\.jsx?$/)
    ),

    // Recreate it with custom exclude filter
    {
      // Called without any arguments, `loaders.js` will return an
      // object like:
      // {
      //   options: undefined,
      //   loader: '/path/to/node_modules/gatsby/dist/utils/babel-loader.js',
      // }
      // Unless you're replacing Babel with a different transpiler, you probably
      // want this so that Gatsby will apply its required Babel
      // presets/plugins.  This will also merge in your configuration from
      // `babel.config.js`.
      ...loaders.js(),

      test: /\.jsx?$/,

      // Exclude all node_modules from transpilation, except for 'swiper' and 'dom7'
      exclude: modulePath =>
        /node_modules/.test(modulePath) &&
        !/node_modules\/(swiper|dom7)/.test(modulePath),
    },
  ]

  // This will completely replace the webpack config with the modified object.
  actions.replaceWebpackConfig(config)
}
```
