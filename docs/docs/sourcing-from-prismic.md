title: Sourcing from Prismic
---

In this guide, we'll walk through setting up a site with content management using [Prismic](https://prismic.io/).

Prismic is a hosted, proprietary Headless CMS (SaaS) with a web app for creating and publishing content. It's suitable for marketers, editors and developers as it has both a "Writing Room" and a fully-fledged API & Content backend. Besides the usual advantages of a SaaS CMS (hosting, security, updates) Prismic offers features like: Custom type builder, scheduling and content versioning and multi-language support.

_Note: This guide uses the Gatsby Hello World starter to provide a very basic understanding of how Prismic can work with your Gatsby site. If you'd like to start with a full blown template, check out [gatsby-starter-prismic](https://github.com/LeKoArts/gatsby-starter-prismic)._
