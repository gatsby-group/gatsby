title: Working with Fonts and Typography
---

In this section, you will learn Gatsby’s approach to fonts and typography. You will also learn how to use different fonts for styling text in your project. You can use local fonts, web fonts, and typography frameworks.

Gatsby doesn’t have an opinion about which [styling approach](/docs/styling/) you choose. Most every possible option is supported through official and community plugins. (If there isn’t a plugin yet for your favorite option, consider [contributing](/docs/creating-plugins) one!)
