title: Gatsby REPL
---

The Gatsby REPL ("read-eval-print loop") is available via the Gatsby CLI by running the command `gatsby repl`. This gives you access to an interactive REPL shell within the context of your Gatsby environment. It can be used to retrived general data and programatically interact with it. If you have an idea for a new command, feel free to submit a PR for it!

This doc will give a brief description of each REPL command, expected output, and an example of what you can do with the command to digest the data. Examples are using the [Gatsby Starter Blog](/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog/) as an demo environment, since it is currently the highest rated starter, and provides standard output for most of these commands.

To get started, in your terminal, after running the initial site setup steps [here](/docs/quick-start), run the command `gatsby repl` to enter the interactive shell.
