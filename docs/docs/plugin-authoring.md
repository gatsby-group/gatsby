title: Plugin Authoring
---

Creating custom plugins in Gatsby is a breeze with our straightforward authoring process.

## Core Concepts

- Every Gatsby plugin is a standalone npm package
- At minimum, a `package.json` is required
- Plugins can be used locally (see [local plugins](#local-plugins) below) or published to npm as packages
- A plugin has access to the the Gatsby [Node](/docs/node-apis/), [SSR](/docs/ssr-apis/), and [browser](/docs/browser-apis/) APIs

## Plugin naming conventions

There are four standard plugin naming conventions for Gatsby:

- **`gatsby-source-*`** â€” a source plugin loads data from a given source (e.g. WordPress, MongoDB, the file system). Use this plugin type if you are connecting a new source of data to Gatsby.
  - Example: `gatsby-source-contentful`
- **`gatsby-transformer-*`** â€” a transformer plugin converts data from one format to another (e.g. CSV to JSON). Use this naming convention
  - Example: `gatsby-transformer-yaml`
- **`gatsby-[plugin-name]-*`** â€” if a plugin is a plugin for another plugin ðŸ˜…, it should be prefixed with the name of the plugin it extends (e.g. if it adds emoji to the output of `gatsby-transformer-remark`, call it `gatsby-remark-add-emoji`). Use this naming convention whenever your plugin will be included as a plugin in the `options` object of another plugin.
  - Example: `gatsby-remark-images`
- **`gatsby-plugin-*`** â€” this is the most general plugin type. Use this naming convention if your plugin doesnâ€™t meet the requirements of any other plugin types.
  - Example: `gatsby-plugin-sass`

## What files does Gatsby look for in a plugin?

- `package.json` â€” [required] used to find the `name` and `version` fields (both optional)
  - this can be an empty object (`{}`) for local plugins
- `gatsby-browser.js` â€” usage details are in the [browser API reference](/docs/browser-apis/)
- `gatsby-node.js` â€” usage details are in the [Node API reference](/docs/node-apis/)
- `gatsby-ssr.js` â€” usage details are in the [SSR API reference](/docs/ssr-apis/)

## Local plugins

When you want to work on a new plugin, or maybe write one that is only relevant
to your specific use-case, a locally defined plugin is more convenient than
having to create an NPM package for it.

You can place the code in the `plugins` folder in the root of your project like
this:

```
plugins
â””â”€â”€ my-own-plugin
    â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

**NOTE:** You still need to add the plugin to your `gatsby-config.js` like for plugins
installed from NPM.

At a minimum, each plugin requires a package.json file, but the minimum content is just an
empty object `{}`. The `name` and `version` fields are read from the package
file. The name is used to identify the plugin when it mutates the GraphQL data
structure. The version is used to clear the cache when it changes.

For local plugins it is best to leave the version field empty. Gatsby will
generate an md5-hash from all `gatsby-*` file contents and use that as the
version. This way the cache is automatically flushed when you change the code of
your plugin.

If the name is empty it is inferred from the plugin folder name.

Like all `gatsby-*` files, the code is not being processed by Babel. If you want
to use JavaScript syntax which isn't supported by your version of Node.js, you
can place the files in a `src` subfolder and build them to the plugin folder
root.
