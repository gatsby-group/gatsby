title: Deploying to the Moovweb XDN
---

This guide will cover deploying a Gatsby site to the Moovweb eXperience Delivery Network (XDN).

The [Moovweb XDN](https://www.moovweb.com/) is an all-in-one platform to develop, deploy, preview, experiment on, monitor, and run your headless frontend. The XDN is focused on large, dynamic websites and best-in-class performance through an integrated Content Delivery Network (CDN), CDN-as-JavaScript, predictive prefetching, and performance monitoring. Moovweb offers a free tier.

This page summarizes the content in the XDN developer docs [Gatsby](https://developer.moovweb.com/guides/gatsby) guide. Refer to that guide for additional details.

## Step 1: Sign up for a free XDN account

In order to deploy you will need an account. You can sign up for a free account on the [Moovweb XDN Sign Up page](https://moovweb.app/signup).

## Step 2: Install the XDN CLI

Install the XDN CLI via `npm`:

```shell
npm install -g @xdn/cli
```

## Step 3: Run XDN `init`

Run the XDN `init` command in your project directory:

```shell
cd my-gatsby-project
xdn init
```

This will automatically add all of the required XDN libraries and files to your project. The full list of changes XDN `init` performs is listed in the [Moovweb XDN Gatsby](https://developer.moovweb.com/guides/gatsby) guide.

## Step 4: Test locally

XDN CLI will emulate the XDN's integrated CDN locally. You can test the XDN integration with your project locally by using the `run` command:

```shell
xdn run
```

Once you run the above command, you should be able to see your local changes by going to `localhost:3001` in your browser.

## Step 5: Deploy

To deploy your app on the XDN run:

```shell
xdn deploy
```

If this is your first time deploying, the `deploy` command will prompt you to sign into your Moovweb account.

When the deployment finishes, the output will confirm the final deployment URL. Below is an example:

```shell
