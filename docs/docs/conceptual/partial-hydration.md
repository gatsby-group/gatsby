Partial Hydration enables you to selectively add interactivity to your otherwise completly static app. This results in improved frontend performance while keeping the benefits of client-side apps. Gatsby uses [React Server Components](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/blob/main/text/0188-server-components.md) to achieve this.

## Why React Server Components?

If you don't know what React Server Components are or need a refresher, we recommend watching [the talk introducing Server Components](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQQPAU21ZUw) or reading the [Server Components RFC](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/blob/main/text/0188-server-components.md).
